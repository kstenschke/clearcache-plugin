The configuration allows to setup (within the project settings) shortcuts for deletion of:

* One or more folders of temporary files within the project
* Removal of hidden files and directories can be de/activated
* Specific files/directories can be excluded from deletion using ignore-patterns


## Keyboard Shortcut

A keyboard shortcut can be assigned under Preferences > Keymap > Plugins > Sweep > Sweep Files


## Please note

The plugin is a tool for deleting configured directories and files located within your project, it is NOT a shortcut to 
remotely evoke clearing the cache of a specific browser or other application.
